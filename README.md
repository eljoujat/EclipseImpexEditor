# Eclipse Impex Editor

<a href="http://marketplace.eclipse.org/marketplace-client-intro?mpc_install=2331084" class="drag" title="Drag to your running Eclipse workspace to install Hybris Impex Editor"><img src="http://marketplace.eclipse.org/sites/all/themes/solstice/_themes/solstice_marketplace/public/images/btn-install.png" alt="Drag to your running Eclipse workspace to install Hybris Impex Editor" /></a>

## Syntax highlighting: 

The Syntax highlighting feature uses the rule based scanner class. The scanner takes a givent number of rules, and cosumes the impex file and evalutes each token. If the token matches a rule, the scanner exits with the corresponding properties. 

The ruleset are based on the Hybris [Impex syntax documentation](https://wiki.hybris.com/display/release5/ImpEx+Syntax)

## Preferences Of the plugins : 

I also used the Preferences API to allow customisation, to give the more friendly user experience. 

It's possible to customize the feel and look of the Impex file:

And you can configure the connection with hybris, to execute and validate the impex with any running instance of hybris !

## Detecting hyrbis Item and attributes : 

The first time eclipse run, the plugin connect to a the already configured running hybris instance (by default the localhost),call the Rest Webservice `allItems` , and `allAttributes` (exposed by hybris) and store the information to avoid call the web service again. 

To detect newly added Items or attributes, I Implementer an action to refresh the already stored data definition. 

## A challenge and a new techniques acquired :  

The web services exposed by hybris require a registered hybris account and it's secured against [Cross-site request forgery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery).

To make a successful call the request should pass a crsf token, the token is associated with the connected account. the challenge was that token is stored on the HTML code of a response, and I had to use the [jsoup](http://jsoup.org/) library to retrieve the token. 

- Make a first to login, the call return with a JSESSIONID, I store the JSESSIONID for a further call. 
- Use jsoup with the stored JSESSIONID, and get the crsf token from the html.
- Make a Rest Call to retrieve the Items and attributes definition.

## The coolest feature : Autocompletion .
The auto-completion is the moste liked what the most user look for in any text editor, since i have stored the data deffinition, this feature was easy to implement as well :

## Install the plugin : 

This project is built using Eclipse Tycho (https://www.eclipse.org/tycho/) and requires at least maven 3.0 (http://maven.apache.org/download.html) to be built via CLI. 
Simply run :

    mvn install

The first run will take quite a while since maven will download all the required dependencies in order to build everything.

In order to use the generated eclipse plugins in Eclipse, you will need m2e (https://www.eclipse.org/m2e) 
and the m2eclipse-tycho plugin (https://github.com/tesla/m2eclipse-tycho/). Update sites to install these plugins : 

* m2e stable update site : http://download.eclipse.org/technology/m2e/releases/
* m2eclipse-tycho dev update site : http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/.m2e/connectors/m2eclipse-tycho/0.7.0/N/0.7.0.201309291400/


To install the features contained here, press Help > Install New Softwareâ€¦ in your Eclipse IDE and enter the URL [http://eljoujat.github.io/updates/](http://eljoujat.github.io/updates/).

## What next: 

Other features I'm working on are : 

- Validate the impex with error markers.
- Execute the impex .
- Hyperlink features to easily locate where an Item is already valued from the same impex .
- Find usage Features, find all usage for the selected definied and selected item . 
- Formatting .
