## Syntax highlighting: 

The Syntax highlighting feature uses the rule based scanner class ;  the scanner toos a givent number of rule, it cosume the impex file and evalute each token, if the token match a rule , the scanner exit with the correspondant properties. 

The ruleset are based on the Hybris [Impex syntax documentation](https://wiki.hybris.com/display/release5/ImpEx+Syntax)

## Preferences Of the plugins : 

I also used the Preferences API to allow customisation, to give the more friendly user experience. 

It's possible to customize the feel and look of the Impex file:

And you can configure the connection with hybris, to execute and validate the impex with any running instance of hybris !

## Detecting hyrbis Item and attributes : 

The first time eclipse run, the plugin connect to a the already configured running hybris instance (by default the localhost),call the Rest Webservice `allItems` , and `allAttributes` (exposed by hybris) and store the information to avoid call the web service again. 

To detect newly added Items or attributes, I Implementer an action to refresh the already stored data definition. 

## A challenge and a new techniques acquired :  

The web services exposed by hybris require a registered hybris account and it's secured against [Cross-site request forgery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery).

To make a successful call the request should pass a crsf token, the token is associated with the connected account. the challenge was that token is stored on the HTML code of a response, and I had to use the [jsoup](http://jsoup.org/) library to retrieve the token. 

- Make a first to login, the call return with a JSESSIONID, I store the JSESSIONID for a further call. 
- Use jsoup with the stored JSESSIONID, and get the crsf token from the html.
- Make a Rest Call to retrieve the Items and attributes definition.

## The coolest feature : Autocompletion .
The auto-completion is the moste liked what the most user look for in any text editor, since i have stored the data deffinition, this feature was easy to implement as well :
